      Hey ðŸ‘‹, I'm Tryston! <br /> <br />
      I enjoy programming, talking, and reading.  <br /> <br />
      For the last year, I've been building a website for streaming games, 
      watching videos, and chatting with friends called PlaySpace.  <br /> <br />
      I also enjoy giving talks at local San Diego meetups.  <br /> <br />
      If you're interested in speaking with me, <a href="mailto:tryston@trystonperry.com">
      shoot me an email!</a>
