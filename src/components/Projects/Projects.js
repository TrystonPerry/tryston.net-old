                  Over the last year, I have single handedly built a platform
                  for streaming games, watching videos, and chatting with
                  friends from the comfort of your web browser.

                <h3>San Diego Zoohackathon</h3>
                <span>November 8 - 10 2019</span>
                <p>
                  I participated in a hackathon with one other person on my
                  team. Our goal was to create a webapp that gamified the
                  collection of animal trafficking data. It was built in a Vue
                  front-end with Airtable as the database. We didnâ€™t win, but I
                  did pull off my longest coding stretch of 7am - 1am that I am
                  very proud of.

                  Boarditt is a simple, yet powerful Task Management WebApp. The
                  front-end is built with Angular 5 as a SPA. Using components
                  and services to neatly organize data handled from its back-end
                  API. The back-end uses Node.js, Express.js, and MongoDB to
                  form an API for accessing data like Boards, Lists, and Todos.
